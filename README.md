This project is an implementation of the Neat Matrix Library by Andrei Ciobanu, following his tutorial here: https://www.andreinc.net/2021/01/20/writing-your-own-linear-algebra-matrix-library-in-c

Much of the background functionality was taken directly from Ciobanu's GitHub repo on the project, linked here: https://github.com/nomemory/neat-matrix-library

The contents of the files nml_util.c, nml_util.h, nml.sh, and nmllib.h are taken directly from this repo, as well as portions of the file nmllib.c. However, much of nmllib.c is my own work, coded while following Ciobanu's tutorial. It should be clear from my comments which parts are directly taken from the repo and which ones I coded.

This library should be very self-contained and should not have any issues with dependency.
